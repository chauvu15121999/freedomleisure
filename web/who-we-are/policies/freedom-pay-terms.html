<p><br />
<strong>3. Repayments and refunds<br />
<br />
3.1 Repayments</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>Once we pay a Payment Amount on your behalf to the Recipient at your request, you owe us that amount. You must pay to us, in relation to each Payment Amount:
	<ol>
		<li>the repayments in the amount and at the frequency or on the dates specified in the Payment Plan for the relevant Purchase from the Start Date (unless there is a Default, in which case you must pay us in accordance with this Agreement); and</li>
		<li>any additional fees not included in the Payment Amount.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If an amount is due on a day that is not a Business Day or a day that does not exist (e.g. 30 February) you must pay us that amount on the next Business Day.</li>
	<li>The repayment amount stated in a Payment Plan excludes any government duties applicable to the repayment and does not include any fees or charges payable under a Payment Plan other than the Monthly Maintenance Fee (if applicable).</li>
	<li>We will notify you of the Start Date for a Payment Amount. The Start Date for a Payment Amount will typically be the date we pay the Payment Amount to the Merchant, unless we notify you of a different Start Date.</li>
	<li>You must make the repayments by direct debit from the bank account or credit card shown in the applicable Payment Plan or by any other manner approved by us. You must ensure that there are sufficient funds in that account to allow any repayment to be honoured.</li>
	<li>You can make repayments or pay fees and charges ahead of time, if you like.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We will apply a payment received in the following order in repayment of any unpaid amounts to the extent that the relevant items have been charged to your Account at the time the repayment is processed:
	<ol>
		<li>enforcement expenses;</li>
		<li>government taxes, duties or charges;</li>
		<li>fees payable under this Agreement;</li>
		<li>any Outstanding Payment Amounts; and</li>
		<li>any other part of the Balance Owing.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>All repayments, fees and charges, once paid, are not refundable unless we have received payment in error or you are entitled to a refund under the Australian Consumer Law or any other law.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<strong>4. Fees and Charges</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>Subject to clause 9.1(c), you must pay us:
	<ol>
		<li>a Monthly Maintenance Fee of $6.00 which covers our reasonable administration fees in relation to this Agreement (such as monitoring repayments and issuing account statements). This fee is due and payable each month on the first Business Day of each month if the Balance Owing has been greater than zero on any day since the first Business Day of the previous month. This is only charged once each month;&nbsp;</li>
		<li>a Late Payment Fee of $10.00 each time a repayment is not paid by the due date for payment as set out in the Payment Plan; &nbsp;</li>
		<li>all additional government stamp and other duties and charges payable on receipts or withdrawals under this Agreement; and</li>
		<li>any reasonable Costs we reasonably incur in enforcing this Agreement after a Default, which includes enforcement expenses reasonably incurred by the use of our staff and facilities.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>You authorise us to debit any of these amounts to your Account in which case they form part of the Total Amount Owing. We may do so on or after the date we pay them or the date they become payable by you or us. If they are not already due, they are due when debited to the Account.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<p><strong>5. Default</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>You are in Default if:
	<ol>
		<li>you do not pay amounts due under this Agreement within 2 Business Days of their due date;</li>
		<li>you or another person on your behalf gives us or has given us incorrect or misleading information in connection with your Account, this Agreement, a Payment Plan or we conclude on the basis of evidence available to us that it is more likely than not that you have acted fraudulently in connection with your Account, this Agreement, or a Payment Plan; or</li>
		<li>you become Insolvent or are declared bankrupt or steps are taken to make you bankrupt or Insolvent.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If you are in Default, we will give you a notice stating that you are in Default. If you don&rsquo;t correct the Default within the applicable grace period given in the notice (which we will decide, acting reasonably), then, at the end of that period and without further notice to you, the Total Amount Owing becomes immediately due for payment (to the extent it is not already due for payment). We may then sue you for that amount.</li>
	<li>Reasonable Enforcement expenses may become payable under this Agreement in the event of Default and are payable in accordance with clause 4.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<strong>6.&nbsp;Disputes, complaints and refunds<br />
<br />
6.1 Disputes and complaints</strong>

<ol type="a">
	<li>Subject to clause 6.2, if you want to dispute a transaction or make a complaint about your Account or a Payment Plan, you should tell us as soon as possible using the contact details set out on our website from time to time (or as otherwise advised to you) and provide us with sufficient information or documents for us to be able to investigate the matter.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We will investigate the matter, and if we are unable to settle it to both parties&rsquo; satisfaction, we will advise you in writing of the procedures for further investigation and resolution and may request further relevant details from you.</li>
	<li>Within 21 days of receipt from you of the details of the disputed transaction or your complaint, we will:
	<ol>
		<li>complete our investigation and advise you in writing of the outcome of our investigation; or</li>
		<li>advise you in writing that we require further time to complete our investigation,&nbsp;unless there are exceptional circumstances in which case we will let you know the reasons for the delay.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>&nbsp;If we find that an error was made, we will make any appropriate adjustments to your Account (and any associated Payment Plan) and notify you in writing of the amount of any adjustment.</li>

<ol type="a">

		<li>continue to make repayments to us and to pay any related fees and charges until the Total Amount Owing is paid in full.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Subject to clause 6.2(c), if we pay the Payment Amount on your behalf and you no longer wish to proceed with the good or service provided by the Merchant to which the Payment Amount relates you are still required to continue to make repayments to us and to pay any related fees and charges until the Total Amount Owing is paid in full.</li>
	<li>If a Merchant agrees to refund you all or part of the Payment Amount for a Purchase while there is still a Balance Owing in respect of that Purchase, the refund will be made to Freedom Pay and then transferred by us to your nominated bank account and/or applied against the Balance Owing. &nbsp;You agree to, and you appoint us as your attorney to, sign such documents and provide such confirmation and instructions as we may reasonably require, or determine are required, to give effect this clause and facilitate the payment of a refund to Freedom Pay.</li>
	<li>ou acknowledge and agree that Freedom Pay will only be required to transfer to you (and/or apply against the Balance Owing) the amount of the Purchase Price paid by the Merchant to Freedom Pay and if this amount is less than the amount agreed between you and the Merchant you:
	<ol>
		<li>must seek the balance from the Merchant; and</li>
		<li>hold Freedom Pay harmless in respect of any such shortfall.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
